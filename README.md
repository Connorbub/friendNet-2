# friendNet-2
## Synopsis

A basic social network written with PHP and MySQL.

## Motivation

I  made this site simply as a hobby, and don't intend on using it for anything serious.

## Installation

To get the project, you will need XAMPP. Next, create a new folder in your C:/XAMPP/htdocs directory. Download the project as a zip, and move the files to the new folder. Lastly, start the Apache and MySQL servers, open a web browser, and type in http://localhost/[The name of the folder you created]
